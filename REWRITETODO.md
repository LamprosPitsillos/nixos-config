# NIXOS
[o] Secrets
[-] Split config to:
    [o] HomeLab
    [x] Inferno
[o] QuickShell

## Neovim
It has been almost a year since I modified my config in a significant way
These are the changes am looking for:
- Proper Debuging support
- LLM integration
    Since I do sometimes use LLMS I prefer to not leave my editor and have to copy paste stuff
- Ease of Life
    - `statuscolumn`
        - git signs
        - debbug signs
        - relative numbers in all modes except cmdline mode ( for ex commands )
+ Rewrite LSPs


## HomeLab
The main point of the homelab will be to learn and experiment, thats why I will be using programs that are considered industry standards (nginx, dockers) instead of native NixOs modules hiding complexity

I want to selfhost:
    - NAS
    - [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/installation/alternative#docker-compose)
    - [Immich](https://github.com/immich-app/immich)
    - [PenPot](https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started/docker/#example-with-caddy-server)
    - [PiHole](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker)
