# NIXOS
- Secrets
- Split config to:
    - HomeLab
    - Inferno

## Neovim
It has been almost a year since I modified my config in a significant way
These are the changes am looking for:
- Proper Debuging support
- LLM integration
    Since I do sometimes use LLMS I prefer to not leave my editor and have to copy paste stuff
- Ease of Life
    - `statuscolumn`
        - git signs
        - debbug signs
        - relative numbers in all modes except cmdline mode ( for ex commands )


## HomeLab
The main point of the homelab will be to learn and experiment, thats why I will be using programs that are considered industry standards (nginx, dockers) instead of native NixOs modules hiding complexity

I want to selfhost:
    - [PenPot](https://help.penpot.app/technical-guide/getting-started/docker/#example-with-caddy-server)
    - [PiHole](https://github.com/pi-hole/docker-pi-hole/#running-pi-hole-docker)
